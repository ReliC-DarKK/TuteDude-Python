<h1><b>
  ASSIGNMENT 1
</b></h1>

<h2>
  Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations</h2>
  <h3> It is a basic calculator that performs all basic mathematical functions.
  <br>
  It inputs two float-type numericals from user using input function and performs addition, subractiion, multiplication and division. It then prints the values using print function.
  </h3>

<h2>
  Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting </h2>
  <h3>
  It inputs the first name and last name from user and greets them using print function.
  </h3>

<h1><b>
  ASSIGNMENT 2
</b></h1>

<h2>
  Task 1: Check whether the number is odd or even.</h2>
  <h3> It uses the '%' function for remainder.
  <br>
  It inputs an integer from user. 
  If the remainder of the number on dividing by 2 is zero, the number is even.
  Else it is odd.
  </h3>

<h2>
  Task 2: Count from 1 to 50 </h2>
  <h3>
  The logic uses a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers. The range() function generates integers starting from the first value (1) and stopping before the second value (51), ensuring numbers up     to 50 are included. Each number i in this sequence is then printed. 
  </h3>

  <h1><b>
  ASSIGNMENT 3
</b></h1>

<h2>
  Task 1: Create a factorial calculator function.</h2>
  <h3> It uses recursion for printing the factorial..
  <br>
  It inputs an integer from user. 
  We can write n! = n*(n-1)! ==> n!= n*(n-1)*(n-2)! and so on.
  So the function calls n*factorial(n-1) and it runs as a recursive function to calculate the factorials of the subsequent terms till we reach 1.
  </h3>

<h2>
  Task 2: Using math module calculate sqrt, natural log and sine. </h2>
  <h3>
   This code imports the math module.
   Then using the functions in the math module (sqrt, log and sin), it calculates the required values.
  </h3>
